This is the repository of abundance data for stars. A list of all stars currently in the database is included in the file "MasterList.txt".


*Instructions for adding data:*

Each star should be entered as its own datafile, with a filename "<Object ID>.dat". Please check if the object already exists -- if it does add a suffix of "_n" where n is the current number of files for that object +1. The first row of the file should begin with "#" and give a bibliographic reference for where the data comes from. Each entry should be supplied on a separate row, with error bars if possible. Make sure you minimally supply the stellar parameters log g, T_eff and [Fe/H], as well as the abundance data.
