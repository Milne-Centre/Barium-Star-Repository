The Master_Milne_RVs.dat file contains RV data for a set of chemically peculiar, binary, or suspected to be at least one of these. Data format is: Star Name, heliocentric julian date, heliocentric-corrected radial velocity, radial velocity error. This file will be updated soon, and likely split into many files for each star.
