The s-process can also be traced in old, metal-poor stars, namely, the so-called Carbon Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, which depending on their heavy element content are sub-classified into groups. Here the Ba (s-process) rich variation tends to be binary systems (in 80-100% of the cases; Starkenburg et al. 2014, Hansen et al. 2016), where an AGB in the past transferred C and s-process material onto the CEMP that we can observe today. The AGB is (typically) long gone. Abundances of the CEMP stars can be found in the link below, which contains a table (Placco etal. 2014) and header with the needed readme information about the
content.
