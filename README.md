# Barium-Star-Repository

This repository is designed to be an archive of data for barium stars, developed for the ChETEC-INFRA network. It contains three separate directories, which are:

- **Stellar parameters and abundance data**, including data collected from literature sources.
- **Radial velocity data**
- **Spectra**

Data generated as part of the action will be added to the repository as it becomes available.
